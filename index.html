        //NOTES
        /*
        You don't have to repeat the vertex data in order to make triangles. 
        Using something called Index Buffers, you can feed a separate list of values to the GPU 
        that tells it what vertices to connect together into triangles so that they don't need to be duplicated. 


        Shaders are small programs that you write and that execute on your GPU. Each shader operates on a different stage of the data: 
        Vertex processing, Fragment processing, or general Compute. Because they're on the GPU, they are structured more rigidly than your average JavaScript.
        But that structure allows them to execute very fast and, crucially, in parallel!


        Shaders in WebGPU are written in a shading language called WGSL (WebGPU Shading Language). 
        WGSL is, syntactically, a bit like Rust, with features aimed at making common types of GPU work (like vector and matrix math) easier and faster.
